# Start here

femu is a 68K-assembly software FPU emulator for Amiga. We're working
through a checklist of performance ideas, one branch at a time, each one
measured. Read `CLAUDE.md` for how we work, `README.md`'s "Performance
Optimization Plan" section for the checklist, `BENCHMARK.md` for how to
measure. Don't re-derive any of that here — this file just says what's
next.

## Do this

1. `git checkout master && git pull`
2. Open `README.md`, find the checklist. Pick the lowest-numbered row that
   is still 🔲 *Not started* and whose `Depends on` column is already ✅.
3. `git checkout -b perf/<id>-<slug>`
4. Implement that one idea. Nothing else.
5. Build and run `bench/` (see `BENCHMARK.md`) before *and* after, same
   golden vectors, same CPU target(s) the idea claims to help.
6. Update the checklist row: ✅ + measured delta and merge, or ❌ +
   ~~strike~~ + one-sentence reason and leave the branch pushed. Never
   delete a branch.
7. Back to step 1.

## Current state

Checklist item `#0` (the `bench/` harness itself) hasn't been built yet —
nothing downstream of it can be *measured* yet, only implemented. If `#0`
isn't ✅, do that first regardless of what else looks tempting.
